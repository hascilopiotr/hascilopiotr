### 🚀 Featured Projects

**🏦 [Credit Risk & Default Prediction Engine]**
* **Goal:** Minimize financial exposure by predicting loan default probabilities on imbalanced datasets.
* **Tech:** Python, Scikit-Learn, SHAP, Pandas, Matplotlib.
* **Details:** Built a Random Forest classifier optimizing for Precision-Recall AUC. Implemented a custom threshold-tuning strategy (0.2 cutoff) and a business logic layer to segment applicants into Accept, Review, and Reject tiers, *successfully capturing 96% of high-risk clients.
* 👉 [Check out the Repository](https://github.com/hascilopiotr/LoanPrediction.git)

**💵 [Restaurant Tipping Prediction Model]** 
* **Goal:** Model and explain factors influencing tip amounts.  
* **Tech:** Python, Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression), Pandas, Seaborn.  
* **Details:** EDA showed a strong positive link between total bill and tip. Built a regression model (MSE ≈ 0.70) to predict tips from customer and bill features.  
* 👉 [Check out the Repository](https://github.com/hascilopiotr/KaggleCustomersTipping.git)

**🛒 [E-Commerce Customer Segmentation & Recommendation System]**
* **Goal:** Optimize marketing strategies and increase customer lifetime value through behavioral analysis.
* **Tech:** Python, Scikit-Learn (K-Means), Pandas, Seaborn, RFM Analysis.
* **Details:** Processed transactional data to classify customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores. Applied K-Means clustering to identify distinct shopper personas (e.g., "Whales," "Loyalists," "Churn Risks") and implemented * Market Basket Analysis (Apriori algorithm) to generate "Frequently Bought Together" product recommendations.
